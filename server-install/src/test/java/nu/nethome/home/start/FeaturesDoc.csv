433MHz;The 433 MHz frequency band is free in Europe, and is widely used for simpler remote switches and remote sensors like thermometers. A majority of the remote switches and thermometers use this band. To use such devices you need some kind of RF transmitter, for example a TellstickDuo.
868MHz;The 868MHz band is more restricted than the 433MHz band and is not so common for simpler remote control systems.
Auto Detect;Many of the HomeItems support AutoDetect, which means that OpenNetHome can detect their presence and automatically configure the HomeItem for the detected real world device, such as a thermometer or a lamp.
Automation;OpenNetHome supports many forms of automation, to be able to make your home react to changes and conditions that are detected. Typical automation Items are timers or value triggers.
